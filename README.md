# Terraform AWS VPC with Bastion, NAT, and Private Instances

End-to-end infrastructure automation using Terraform and Ansible to deploy a secure AWS VPC with a bastion host, NAT instance, and scalable private instances.

## What This Builds

- 1 VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
- 1 Public Subnet
  - Bastion Host (SSH entry point)
  - NAT Instance (outbound internet for private hosts)
- 2 Private Subnets
  - Scalable private EC2 instances (no public IPs)
- Security Groups configured for:
  - Bastion → NAT access
  - Bastion → Private access
  - Private → NAT outbound access

  ## Architecture Overview

- Bastion host is the only public entry point (SSH)
- NAT instance provides outbound internet access for private instances
- Private instances have **no public IPs**
- All management of NAT and private instances is done via the bastion (ProxyJump)

### Access Flow

Your Machine → Bastion (public IP) → NAT / Private (private IPs)

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured (`aws configure`)
- Terraform installed
- Ansible installed
- Existing EC2 key pair in AWS
- SSH private key stored locally (e.g., `~/.ssh/YOURKEY.pem`)

## Configuration

Copy the example variables file:
```
cp terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars
```
Then update the values in **terraform.tfvars**:

- admin_cidr = your public IP in CIDR format
- key_name = your existing AWS EC2 key pair name
- private_1_count = number of private instances in subnet 1
- private_2_count = number of private instances in subnet 2

## Deployment

Run the deployment script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will:

1) Apply Terraform infrastructure
2) Configure instances with Ansible
3) Set up NAT routing and persistence
4) Reboot instances if required
5) Output infrastructure details at the end

## SSH Access

This project uses a bastion host as the single public SSH entry point.

- Your machine connects directly to the bastion using its public IP
- The NAT instance is managed through the bastion using its private IP
- Private instances are also managed through the bastion using their private IPs

### Access Path

Your Machine → Bastion (public) → NAT / Private Instances (private)
